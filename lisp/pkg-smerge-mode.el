;;; SMERGE
;; Smerge is included for resolving merge conflicts in files. It provides a simple interface
;; to help you keep changes from either the upper or lower version during a merge.
;; This package is built-in, so there's no need to fetch it separately.
;; The keybindings below did not needed to be setted, are here just to show
;; you how to work with it in case you are curious about it.
